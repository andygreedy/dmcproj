            <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">In April 2020, the Financial Committee of the Hong Kong Legislative
                Counsel
                approved the Employment Support Scheme (ESS) 2020—
                a key component of Hong Kong’s Anti-epidemic Fund 2.0 in reaction to the outbreak of Covid-19, aiming at
                enabling HK employers to retain their employees and provide wages.
                Over 150,000 employers benefited from the scheme and more than HK$90 billion was distributed to
                businesses.
                This made the ESS the largest transfer payment in HK corporate history.

            <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                A new round of ESS, which was expected to cost as much as an extra $HK43 billion to the government,
                rolled
                out in March 2022 under the Omicron Fifth Wave.
                In addition, some new provisions were applied to the 2022 scheme after receiving some criticism that the
                original ESS disproportionately benefited
                conglomerates, which might not necessarily suffer any business downturn under the pandemic (eg.
                telecommunication companies & supermarkets).

                Hong Kong's Covid-hit economy will likely return to growth this year as the city opens up and China's

                However, the city is facing some employment issues including the loss of the workforce. Meanwhile,
                certain
                industries (eg. tourism) find it
                difficult to fill the corresponding job vacancies amid the business recovery.

                    <p></p>

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify" ”>
                        Since the global outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020, Hong Kong has implemented various control
                        measures including travel and business restrictions over the course of the pandemic.
                        Many businesses have struggled with decreased demand for goods and services,
                        and some employers were forced to reduce their staff or cut working hours.
                        Referring to Census Department, HK's annual
                        unemployment rate for 2020 was 5.83% (+2.9pp, YoY)
                        which was the highest since 2003 upon the impact of SARS.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        To maintain employment during the epidemic, the HKSAR government hence launched an ESS,
                        which will provide time-limited financial support to employers to retain their employees
                        who will otherwise be made redundant. Similar schemes had been rolled out by other jurisdictions
                        (e.g. Singapore, UK, Australia) to retain/support jobs.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        Generally speaking, the government covered 50% of employees' salaries up to a subsidy cap of
                        HK$9,000 per month
                        for 6 months from June to November 2020, divided into 2 phases each of 3 months. Each phase had
                        to be separately claimed.
                        Eligible employers are those who meet the following conditions:
                    </p>



                    <ol class="fw-bolder">
                        <li>Have been making Mandatory Provident Fund
                            (MPF) contributions or have set up Occupational Retirement Schemes (ORSO
                            schemes) for their employees</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Provide an undertaking that they will:

                                <li>Use the full amount of the subsidies to pay their employees’ wages</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        In addition, employers could not apply subsidies for employees with more than HK$30000 monthly
                        income. The scheme also covered self-employed persons (SEPs) who have
                        made MPF contributions in the past 15 months. Eligible SEPs would be granted a
                        one-off lump-sum subsidy of HK$7,500.

                    <h2>Controversies of the Employment Support Scheme</h2>
                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">The Hong Kong Employment Support Scheme (ESS) has faced
                        criticism from some quarters, particularly from smaller businesses who felt that the scheme
                        was biased towards larger companies. For instance, there were over 150,000 employers included in
                        the scheme but the top 10 conglomerates already received over 5% of the total subsidies.
                        Although the government has repeatedly denied this, there was a sense that the distribution of
                        the subsidy undermined the government's efforts to provide equal support to all businesses
                        affected by the pandemic. </p>

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        Additionally, there were concerns that the scheme did not offer enough transparency in terms of
                        how the subsidies were allocated and whether they were going to the businesses that needed them
                        the most.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        Activist investor David Webb said the handout scheme was “misconceived” and ended up being
                        government “largesse” to corporations. “It would only be fair to compensate businesses ordered
                        to shut down by the government,” he argued.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        Among the top recipients, billions went to businesses that were unaffected or even performed
                        better during the pandemic, such as supermarkets and telecommunication companies. On the other
                        hand, companies like Cathay Pacific were forced to cut thousands of jobs to survive. Resources
                        could have been allocated more efficiently to the industries that were severely impacted by
                        Covid.

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        Another criticism of the ESS was that it did not do enough to support certain groups of
                        employees, such as freelancers and those in the gig economy, whose incomes were seriously
                        hindered by the pandemic but were not covered by the scheme. Some argued that the government
                        should have provided support to these individuals through alternative means, such as targeted
                        financial assistance or job training programs.

                        Meanwhile, 215,000 self-employed people were each eligible for a one-off handout of HK$7,500
                        from the scheme, the government said in 2020. However, only about 57% of them ultimately
                        received the one-off ESS subsidy.

                        Another related issue was the temporary nature of the support provided by the ESS. The subsidies
                        only provided short-term relief and did not address the longer-term challenges faced by
                        businesses in the post-pandemic economic landscape. A more comprehensive and sustainable
                        approach was called to support businesses and employees as they navigate the ongoing challenges
                        and uncertainties brought about by the pandemic.

                        Including the self-employed subsidies, the ESS disbursed HK$91.4 billion in total. The sum was
                        HK$10.4 billion, or about 12.8 %, more than the HK$81 billion earmarked when the scheme was
                        first announced.

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        Overall, the ESS was a bold attempt to support businesses during an unprecedented crisis. Over
                        1.9 million employee headcounts were secured by the scheme during the specified period,
                        exceeding the estimates by about 440,000.

                        the challenge of retaining talent. There are also concerns about a manpower shortage and the
                        city's ability to cope with increased pressure on tourism and other services. Work-life balance
                        and remote working arrangements are also emerging as important issues. Compounding these
                        challenges is an ongoing debate about Hong Kong's prospects as a global metropolis compared to
                        other competitors.

                        Singapore has been stepping up its efforts to attract top talents in recent years, while
                        Hong Kong has faced challenges related to its political climate and travel restrictions during
                        the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in Singapore gaining an edge in areas such as
                        ESG hiring and fintech talent.

                    <p class="fw-bolder text-justify">
                        One of the key issues is that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant loss of workforce,
                        exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. In 2022, Hong Kong recorded a 2.4%
                        decrease in the labour force, which is the biggest drop in history. Since 2018, the total labour
                        force reduces by more than 5.51% from 3.99 million to 3.77 million.
                        According to government documents,
                        around 116,600 young Hong Kongers aged 18 to 39 left the workforce in the past two years. There is 
                        concern that the city failed to retain its young talent.

                        There are ongoing efforts to reverse this trend,

                        to work in Hong Kong, and the Global Talent Visa program, which offers permanent residency for
                        highly skilled and talented individuals. Along with these efforts, there have been calls for the
                        government to invest in education and technology to develop local talent and address the skills
                        gap. However, this issue is unlikely to be solved in the short term as the downward trend of
                        labour
                        is expected to continue in the next few years.
